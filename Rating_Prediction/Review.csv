274,1,"1. Guys these people won't provide the original acer charger which is Highly disappointing.2. Build quality is very poor from Acer.You have to use it as desktop, I mean to say you can't use roughly like other branded laptops.3. Display quality is not good. Ex. Mi vs OnePlus4. Sound : Don't keep much expectations.5. Battery: Yo so far it's goodMake sure you are returning within the mentioned date or else no one comes to help."

278,1,Not a worth purchase. Lags a lot heats alot even after playing games on low. Fans are way louder than anything my cieling fan makes less noise than it. Way heavier than other gaming laptops. Please go for other varieties like HP omen lenovo legion MSI not a worth purchase.

280,1,This is worthless product. I faced screen freezing issue from the very day I got it . It types by 1 -2 second delay in MS Office. The customer care service is too time consuming and unsupportive. They would take at least 2 weeks to approach at your location if you lodge any complaint regarding notebook. I felt looted with it.
281,1,"I purchased this laptop two days ago for my daughter's online school. The problem I observed is it lack RAM. The laptop freees while using MS teams. We have to forcefully power it off.I would suggest, you guys can go for any other laptop with Minimum 8 GB RAM."
282,1,very bad this laptop has major heating issue and it starts lagging from the first day. and dont expect free fire to play in this laptop. i am very disatisfied
283,1,Pls never buy this product as you get only 3.5 gb of ram for windows 10 and the processor runs too hot and at idle condition stays near 55 to 60 degrees with the junction temp at 95 degrees. Flipkart doesnt offer return only policy they only replace the product if defective. never buy this even though it is a budget laptop with ssd.

And started disconnecting automatically, I thought maybe it's my device failure to connect and tried to connect with another device
But still faced the same problem again and again
Then I do all the diagnosis to resolve the issue but nope, nothing made difference in it
I used it for 3 days but faced the same issue again and again
So decided to return it.

3380,1,"Sound Quality is Impressive. Nothing to complain about.
The carrying case can charge the earbuds upto 3 times to a full charge
I use a single earbud at a time, because I mostly use it for phone conversations.
Perfect fit inside a helmet while riding a bike.
But i do enjoy the stereo quality at times.
Excellent price for triple nine.
Better than expected.
Finally a functional product that will use.

Edit: Right Earbud stopped functioning after 2 months. Now left earbud also stopped functioning after 3 months.
Will edit review with warranty feedback."

A lot is said about noise cancellation. If you are sitting in a room with any fan running, otherside on the phone won't listen a thing except for a lot of wind noise.
Most of the time even without fan running, I get the feedback that they were not able to understand what I am saying till the point I remove the device and talk directly.

4371,2,"Average display quality, poor camera, very poor battery life.Laptop Fan is noisy, laptop body paint is warring out..The only positive is the cost effectiveness with this sort of config..if ur looking for a cheap machine with these config go for it.. else AVOID buying it..."

4428,2,Laptop Heating up very fast. Low quality speakers and volume is really low. The Device is not upto the mark at this price range. Poor battery backup lasts max 2.5 hrs and 4 hours if battery saver is continuously ON.Feels little heavy compared with HP. I would suggest go for HP in this variant. Overall not worth the price.
4429,2,Great laptop for normal use. RAM is not upgradable. That's a deal breaker. Camera is just average. Performance is great! Built quality is great. Battery is back up is 6-7 hours.

So the battery drains too fast, you'll never get battery back up of more than 3.5 hours while using internet connection. As per price 47k, the laptop is not worth to buy. It'll be an deal when one can get it below 40k."

4472,2,Bad laptop
4473,2,A 2 start product. Very slow in performance. On papers the specifications looks good but in actual I am really disappointed as the performance is slow in many areas starting from booting. Even opening a browser and switching between tabs takes more time then expected and the system freezes intermittently when working on multiple tabs. Clicking on tabs/buttons doesn't act immediately. All-n-all I would not suggest this model.Written this review after using for over a month.
4474,2,Way to slow
4475,2,"Windows Runs slowly on it, within 4 days hard disk got crashed, when contacted HP customer care, they didn't resolved the issue on time. Poor customer service, it's better to buy from store rather than online"

4804,2,Battery performance is very poor. I am not satisfied with this product but now what can I do
4805,2,Not happy as this is not for heavy games. Sometimes I used to play games like of 40gb games but it is not good at that. This is an official laptop for office work only with ok ok battery backup. Hope you should buy another as this is an ok ok laptop only.
4806,2,Build quality is super bad.. keep breaking in bits and pieces from edges.. display should be better at this price range.. performance is good.
4807,2,"Very poor display. Build quality is not great either (corner of lower body broke off, I use it very carefully). Upgrading RAM is not straight forward either, the whole lower part needs to be opened. 4GB RAM is soldered, so cannot be removed, only the other 4GB can be upgraded, so it will be an imbalanced setup. First time spent big on Asus, and was a total disappointment."

IS IT EVEN GENUINE PRODUCT OR JUST A COPY!?

The pairing is quite fast.
The quality of the charging case is substandard and Cheap.
Sound is just OK."

 First and foremost, it's a very cheap product, so it's impossible to expect a lot of high class features from this set. So don't keep your hopes high.
I will not go on listing the pros and cons. However I will just give a short review.
The sound quality is good, it has good volume and also good bass. The pairing is to the point and quick, so it is good in that respect. The battery is also good and lasts long with a single charge.
The most important thing I don't like about this is the microphone. It doesn't have any kind of ANC. And moreover while in a call, even the smallest sounds get amplified to a great extent, which might be good when you're indoors in a quiet environment. However, even if your TV is running at a small volume, it will affect your calling, and the one on the other side might not hear your clearly. This is most irritating outdoors, when you recieve a call because it's most certain that no one can hear whatever you're saying because the noises of cars, vehicles, pedestrians gets amplified too much and your voice is barely audible. It's fine to listen to music while travelling and such, but it's not at all good for calls on the go."

The only reason to consider is, If you are looking for a cheap ipx buds.

What I liked:
- It works
- It's cheap
- Noise cancellation is decent due to rubber buds.
- Battery Backup

What I hate:
- Looks cheap build
- Both case and bud quality are actually not that good.
- Base I felt is too flat. (If you like songs with too many Beats, you might like it but if you are a soft music lover, you might be disappointed.)
- No noice cancellation ( Don't expect at this price)
- Mic quality could have been a little better.

Overall: Buyable but don't set high expectations."

Mic is equal to non existent. If you are even walking, the sound gets distorted due to interference. On a run or a bike, it gets really irritating for the other person. Also, the distance of the mic to catch the sound is low. If you speak in a low voice, the other person cannot hear you."

This pen drive is super durable and long lasting. I have even left it in my pocket and it was washed in washing machine 4-5 times and still functioning.
The major and only downside is the write speed. Yes its usb 2.0 and i dont expect usb 3 speed but write speed average around 4.5 MBps. That is really low even from usb 2 standards(my other USB 2.0 pen drive delivers upto 25-30MBps).
So Please dont buy this for daily use purpose and its frustratingly slow but its great to use a backup for phots and music collection."

The major and only downside is the write speed. Yes its usb 2.0 and i dont expect usb 3 speed but write speed average around 4.5 MBps. That is really low even from usb 2 standards(my other USB 2.0 pen drive delivers upto 25-30MBps).
So Please dont buy this for daily use purpose and its frustratingly slow but its great to use a backup for phots and music collection."

Too much noise is being picked up, sometimes either constant OR sometimes intermittent - but very sharp noises - that causes irritation of person on the other side.

Tried both with angled clip & without it.
Same results. Seems either some design flaw OR manufacturing defect - not sure if every other customer also facing the same."

I would like to start with the positives but there isn‚Äôt anything I can think of.
Cons -
Does not fit comfortably in the ears
Sound quality very average
Bass - nothing much

Its been 6 months and already the right ear bud has gone off. I got this for my mother and she uses her things carefully, so was surprised to see this go bad so quickly. The last earphone from evidson lasted us about 3-4 years with good sound.
I will be taking this up with Boult customer care. Hopefully they can resolve this.

Note 2. - As of now both earphones have stopped working within 6 months of purchase. The warranty people said that I should send it to their service center to get it repaired by courier. Guess what they have only one service center in all of India, in Delhi. This is a company interested in sale of cheap products with no intent of customer service.
Do you self a favor and buy Evidson. It worked 4 years beautifully with good sound and quality. Much better than Boult."

8118,3,They not provide the support we have face some problem in our system. I have tried to contact for support in Infinix official website. But we are not able to reach to support team.So my concern is this product is good and also very good design and worth for money. But after purchase definitely we need service provider or support contact.If you have near by infinix service center you can purchase this product üëç.
8119,3,Value for money...Best in the market in this price rangeBut adaptor is defective... Leaking shock during charging

8126,3,"I have noticed an issue with the laptop. When connected to power adapter, if we touch any part of the metal body there will be a vibration(kind of like an earth shock). I had made a replacement and the new piece also has the same issue. I'm sure many others would have noticed. It's very negligible like an earth shock but still a defect nonetheless. When you have kids around it would be a concern to keep using it. Otherwise it's a great value for money product. Love the rest of it."
8127,3,I have just now purchased it only 2 days back. It's too early to give a proper review but I agree that design and cost deserve 4 stars from me.Rest are given three star because I need time to run it. Yes audio quality is too good

8663,3,"No doubt, the laptop is very good. But this 3 star is only for the apple company itself. There is no USB port or card reader port. You will just get 2 type C port and eventually you have to shed extra 6-8k to buy a good quality dock(connector) for this laptop so that you can connect your hard drives, iphone or card reader, etc. Also, even to get a 512GB variant you have to pay a whooping 20k extra. This is insane. Instead of buying 512Gb variant I would suggest to buy a external SSD. I didn‚Äôt...READ MORE"

The laptop comes severely bottlenecks out of the box (GPU bottleneck because of single-channel ram), basically the laptop runs 50 to 70% slower in CPU-intensive games/tasks due to which GPU utilization only goes to 30 to 50%.

8856,3,Laptop is slow most of time its stuck
8857,3,Good
8858,3,Only thing that I didn't like the position of the fans.You can't use it on bed or even on lap for playing. And when u realize this thing is called a laptop for a reason (to put it on lap and use it).I face some minute lags and I don't even know the reason for it. Its just been 1 month since I bought it and it's performance is very good except the fan part ofcourse.
8859,3,"My laptop has heating issues, even when I m not gaming and fan makes lot of sound which is irritating"
8860,3,OK
8861,3,I don't tell this is too good but it is useful to students who are willing to learn by their own.The only problem is booting process otherwise all are good.Thank you flipkart!
8862,3,"Updated...writing this review after moderate use of 3 months. Excellent product. Starting time is less than 8 seconds and shutdown time is 5seconds.

8863,3,SSD is not sufficient u can upgrade and more heating issues
8864,3,The performance is good but the build quality is poor. The worst is the keyboard. Overall OK type product not value for money..
8865,3,Laptop feels very delicate and the keys looks very unfinished. No backlight.Also the touchpad touch feel isn't looking a HP productYou will certainly need an extended mouse and keyboardBootup time is really quick.It will be good if it is built more solid.
8866,3,Battery üîã life is not good very bad üòîüòî

8870,3,"The product is good but Flipkart is not trustable and this customer care very layer as per my experience. He says that already giving you compassion but not give, I have already 20 times complain but do not work. The product does not deliver right time and which are already plus member and delay 1 week.

9005,3,I bought list this laptop for 27000 in sale and this laptop is very good but there is a problem that the graphics takes 2GB of RAM and only 2 GB RAM is remaining for user purpose which is very much low so if you want to buy this laptop just upgrade its ram by 4gb more and it will be great if you to install M2 SSD of 120 GB at least.look wise it is awesome only ram is bottle neck.

9022,3,Ok
9023,3,Nice But Processor Is Too Slow... SSD Is Required For Better Performance
9024,3,Average
9025,3,First impression will fail on performance but if you add 8gb ram‚Ä¶. Laptop will be better ‚Ä¶. If you add 120 sdd‚Ä¶.. it will be much better‚Ä¶.. you have one space for ram and ssd each so you and upgrade and have better performance ‚Ä¶.Laptop design is fabulous‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Price is little high ‚Ä¶

Not FHD support. Upgrade 8GB Ram extra for Photo editing and multi tab browsing. 4 GB RAM is not enough.Pros : Decent sound, good design with separate number key keyboard. Small charger easy to carry ."

9044,3,Great product thanks asus
9045,3,It is a budget laptop good at this price it will be bit slow you need to add an 4gb extra ram in it for good performance and if you expect higer speed Go for 120 or 240 Gb additional nvme ssd. An slot for extra nvme is available 4gb ram is soldered in the laptop and there is one extra slot for the ram which you can expand upto 12Gb

Performance wise it's ok, however sometimes it gets overheated but that is common with gaming and high utilisation apps.Two things that I am very disappointed about are the speaker volume and the battery life. Both of these are below average and needs to be improved. I know that the gaming laptops have less battery life but it's below average and what's with the speaker quality.

9914,3,"I have been using this product for past few months, no words about performance and looks its superb, only problem i face is that system getting over heated after continuous 2 hrs work, also heat fans are placed under screen so that screen is getting very much heated. I doubt why hp did likewise."
9915,3,"Every feature in this laptop is amazing,but i am not satisfied with battery , battery lasts maximum upto 5 hrs"
9916,3,Average product in 66974/-

9944,3,Good
9945,3,As per quality and configuration of laptop it's price is very high.
9946,3,Product is ok but to slow
9947,3,"It's evident that manufactures are deliberately making the new devices slow. The boot time on this thing is about a minute. Chrome takes quite some time to open up. I bought this for work/office purposes so I don't see why I should upgrade the ram. 4gb should be enough but apparently it's not. Applications take time to run/load. My old laptop (which also has the same processor and is about 5yrs old with 4gb DDR3 memory) is faster...In short, it's a cheap tablet in the form of a laptop."
9948,3,"Product look is Good ,Volume keys are not working properly ..overall good product for beginners.processor is slow ,it will take time for multitasking work not able to mobe or toggle between 2 pages quickly"

10050,3,"Pros:
The price is nice in the summer sale.
The sound is good at even 15-20% volume.
The color is good.
Fitting is perfect .
The case has a matt finish so, doesn't hold onto fingerprints.

Cons:
Beast mode isn't working. It switched on once and then could not get it back on even after powering off the buds. Though the touch controls are responding well.
There are no volume controls. Any bud with a stem should have vol controls.
Cyan color is only the ear tips. It should have been on the buds too.
Airdopes 381 are available at the same discount price on Flipkart which are actually costlier than this one."

10790,3,"Sound quality: There are better wired headsets with better sound quality in this price range. However this is one of the best true wireless headset in its category.
Fit in the ear: The ear buds with this product is not upto the level of its competitors. Even boat has headsets with better ear buds in this price range (wired headsets).
Connectivity: In the 3 months that I used, never faced any bluetooth connectivity issues. The headset works as a single earpiece as well as double earpiece. The 2nd earpiece automatically syncs with the other pair when taken out of the case.
Battery life: Comfortably gives more that 10hrs of playback time. And gives a very decent standby time.
Quality of the case: Saw some reviews saying the case lid is bad. However, the quality of the case seemed to be same as that for OnePlus buds which sells at 3 times the price."

Battery life: Comfortably gives more that 10hrs of playback time. And gives a very decent standby time.
Quality of the case: Saw some reviews saying the case lid is bad. However, the quality of the case seemed to be same as that for OnePlus buds which sells at 3 times the price."

10810,3,"The sound quality in general isn't great. The bass in the right ear piece is skewed, causing the sound to split even at medium volume. Battery life is so-so.
Also, it keeps falling out of the ear which is superr bad coz you can lose it and have no way to trace it.
Sometimes it has trouble connecting but the typical ""switch off and on"" usually resolves it.
Bottomline, better to stick with their regular bluetooth earphones instead of these since you cant know quality without using and then on using you can't return it."

And once u paired it with one device, then its very difficult to connect it other device u have to restart it multiple times to connect to other device, not recommended for multiple device use"

Looks very good but it doesn't fit properly inside the ear so you will have to constantly keep putting in back so not the AirPods to buy if you planning to use it for running or workout coz it's a contant distraction to stop, put it back in the ears and resume back to workout every 5 minutes."

There was no protection insulation between the terminals and charging case points (usually will be there in new piece)
Sound quality is decent and bass is not mild.

But I'm a Bass lover...
So I'm disappointed in the product.
The Branding in JBL products will be always higher...

Those who like bass don't go for it.
You will regret it
This earphone is only for Treble and vocal lovers
Thank you..... Hope you buy Products worth your money......."

I am not a heavy user though I do not intend to judge other functions.- User friendly- Computer boot in 14 sec- Fingerprint sensor is OK- Not impressed with battery life.- Personally, Windows 11 is impressive.Go for it if you are not a graphics designer or other professional who needs heavy graphic support.Purchased it with Rs- 36490/-(including 1500/- off with icici credit card EMI)"
12435,4,Well the performance is nice & have a nice UI but the only thing could have been better is it's battery. Otherwise you can go for this product blindly.
12436,4,This is only for offline & office work person performance is very good in this price bracket.... important note - only one thing I don't like about this laptop is 45%ntsc display ...i think it's manage that because of lower price ...those who wants for multimedia don't go for it ...go for the OLED screen varient ...
12437,4,Best Laptop üíª üëå in the segment.Classy performance üëè because of ssd memory.Battery üîã is good enough.Design is so sleeky.Recommend you to buy.

12452,4,"i3 10th gen, obviously it is not for gaming and heavy use. Good for CS students. Battery is just ok ..not so good that is ok in this price.Camera is useless and apeakers are low. If you can compromise with it then go for it."

The biggest issue with the device is, power leaking.As the charger adapter has only two pin and no third pin, which is for earthing.

12688,4,Laptop looks sturdy. Good performance as well. Boot time is very fast compared to my lenovo laptop because of SSD. Value for money at this price. Key board looks awesome. Overall a very a good laptop at this price range.The only con -adapter is not MSI company product. Not sure if seller is not giving or company discontinued giving msi adapter.

12690,4,"Loved the product. Design is just awesome simple but elegant. Based on Screen ratio is also good with minimal bezels. Top Features at this price is really worth. Best laptop for coders. Only cons that i have noticed as of now is its battery backup, on 1 full charge it max to max gives 3 to 4 hours of backup which i think should have been taken care of."
12691,4,"The very handy laptop, it is very light and easy to carry. I'll suggest this laptop for the very basic gaming. The battery is disappointed but the Ryzen 5 is a great processor with 39W battery so here you can't expect a good battery life, I'm using it since 8 days & it's great product and here is no MS office.If your budget is 45k or less than, so I'll suggest go for this one."
12692,4,Performance is much better battery is ok ok about 5-6 hours design is very good easy to handle display is also goodSound quality is also good but volume is not much highAnd overall it is great
12693,4,It's really a wonderful laptop.many of us have doubt that whether programming and solidworks will works or not. I have run both and they really works freely without any lag. I jst love this laptop.it has great premium look. I have a request to msi is expand your service centres. Battery usage 5hr+and charging time is 1.5 hr. They sent me july 2021 model disappointment for me but it's ok.. It gives a little electric shock during charge why I don't know
12694,4,Writing this review after using it for 10 days.* High and smooth performance* IPS Level Display is awesome* Elegant Design* Battery not up to the mark (No MSI charger provided)* Less weight and handy* Hi-Res Audio is okay* Excellent Cooling boost.

12968,4,Asome product.Nice build qualityDescent bettery backupGood processing speedLess boot timeOver all quite interesting deal. Go for it if you're avarger user.
12969,4,The looks and the feel is spot on thought the processor is a lit on the slower side but it is value for money..After a month of usage- the laptop starts in less than 9 secs which is commendable. It offers 3 fan speed mode for better performance and you would hear absolutely nothing even during heavy usage.The battery lasts about 5 hrs with backlight on and moderate usage which is a bit low but it's still absolutely worth it.
12970,4,Since using 3 moths. Value for money. Sound and video quality is great and suitable for multitasking. Slightly heavy for graphical work when using Adobe software. Recommend for beginner users.

Viewing angles are better than most of the competition but the colors look cartoonistic and is not accurate, human skin subjects look paintish and over saturated. Performance somewhat degrades after updating to windows 11. It's better to stick with windows 10 if you want slightly better performance. Overall it's gud purchase."

Viewing angles are better than most of the competition but the colors look cartoonistic and is not accurate, human skin subjects look paintish and over saturated. Performance somewhat degrades after updating to windows 11. It's better to stick with windows 10 if you want slightly better performance. Overall it's gud purchase."
13297,4,Very happy to use it( silver colour)All working betterBelieve.... I play heavy game on this lappy which are farcry 5 and assassins creed origin on medium and low graphics;run smoothly but just heated it . Front cam must be upgrade.battery work an everage .display looks cool. I get it in 8gb ram(I recommend if somebody plan to buy select 8gm ram and ssd)I purchase it for official purpose and work fine

13520,4,The only con with this laptop is its speaker sound which is bit low.Performance is good and battery backup also goes till 3:30- 4 hrs after 7 months of usage( daily 15 hrs )
13521,4,Good product
13522,4,Awesome performance but u will not satisfied from sound qualityAll over its awesome
13523,4,Bang for buckNice product from MSI. Hinge is not so sturdy and speaker could have been better. Everything else is nice
13524,4,All over a wonderful product. Just an minor issue is that it has a bit small battery life
13525,4,Good lap
13526,4,"Laptop performance is excellent. Due to nvme ssd storage, it perform beyond expectations. Only downside is it's battery which gives backup upto 3 hrs only . Otherwise in this price range no other brand will be able to compete this laptop."
13527,4,4 star

13529,4,"First bought MSI. I know it's very good and trusted brand in south east asia countries.Weight less easy to carry for college and office.Performance was awesome, display perfect.Only one thing not there Card reader.Other than that every thing perfect"

13540,4,Everything is fine with the laptop. It's fast to boot smooth in gaming but only setback is it's battery life which is not that efficient even if u r doing normal work on laptop. When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine. If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.
13541,4,I want to say that this laptop is very good for gaming. I have played Gta V and it works very well no lag at all but if you want to play games kindly be sure that the fan vents are not blocked so that the hot air can flow away or else you can face some minor lags on the laptop.

13543,4,No doubt laptop is good . Best laptop in budget everything is good display and performance is very good but battery and sound of laptop is not good at all max battery backup is 3 hours and the sound is very low you can't use laptop sound without speaker or earphones
13544,4,"Great laptop except for a few flaws-Charging port is surprisingly difficult to insert the cable into due to a key like shape-needs to be inserted at a specific angle.Colour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.The cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.Other than that, no specific complaints so far. Using it for a month now. On time and secure delivery by Flipkart"
13545,4,"Nice product. Good laptop for video editing and some programmes which need quite high graphics to run. But not so good for FHD games and programmes which really need high end specs in sense of batteries, multitasking,and constant cooling upto 2 to 3 hours."
13546,4,"Pros:- Value for money- Perfect for everyday task- Good processor(i5 10th gen - 10300H) and NVMe SSD made it ultra fast.(bios time around 2.5 seconds)- Keyboard and trackpad are pretty good- RTX 1650 can handle almost all games at 1080P.

Battery is ok in browsing but in gaming it gives about 50 mins to max 1:30 hours ...it's a beast everything is smooth ..overall it's good if you're looking for budget gaming laptops but if can buy the amd version of this or the Asus tuf they are better than this and faster ... So recommend if you are on a 50 k budget...

13560,4,"Under this price range, any one of the other companies will give you this specs. So go for it. The battery life will disappoint you a little but yes, you can't get all your wishes fulfilled. Anyone who is thinking of buying a laptop under 50000 then go for it...."
13561,4,What a pc Gta 5 giving me more than 100fps in normal settings . if you want a budget gaming laptop then just go for it .
13562,4,"I have read some of the comments before buying, which says battery backup is worst.I feel the same after buying the laptop. With the upgradation of windows 11 have to check if there is any optimization and how the battery stands out after the upgrade."

13567,4,By performance this is a beast and value for moneyMy main reason to buy this laptop was for editing and it satisfied meI tried minecraft at medium settings which gives a very good experience but the only problem with me was heating. I frequently check the temperature of the gpu by hand. I think it is because i am buying a gaming laptop for first time. Battery life little dissapointed

You can't hear anything with your ceiling fan turned on.So be prepared to get a bluetooth speaker with this laptop.For me 3 hours battery life is okay but the speaker output is really bad."

13798,4,"In look it was awesome, before buying I thought it was a heavy laptop by weight, bt after using it physically, I am surely able to tell that it was a good laptop overall. Weight is also fair enough and design, performance are also good. Only battery backup is one issue and heating problem also (little bit)."

13818,4,"Since it was my first laptop, I didn't knew what to expect. It has been almost a week, and I noticed some performance issues like file manager not responding then crashing while browsing through folders with heavy quantity of files. It takes like forever to load & search for a particular file from external hdd. Even with just watching Videos, laptop gets pretty warm, idk if its gonna burn if i start playing games like gta v. Battery life is decent-ish for offline media consumption."

13826,4,"Laptop is good but its sound is too low to hear, if you are buying this laptop then make sure you buy some external speakers with it to hear loud and good sound. I had to give it 5 star but due to the quality of sound of this lappy, i gave 4 star to it."
13827,4,Good hardware with average display
13828,4,"very value for money, but there is a problem that there is no any other slot upgrading storage using SSD as well as HDD. we have to replace the 512 GB ssd with an upgrade upto 2 TB."
13829,4,Product is good
13830,4,It is a great laptop for that price.

13832,4,"Overall good buy under 55k.Pros.1. The battery is okay would not expect much as it's a gaming laptop.2. Performance is superb3. It looks gr8 and weight is also well distributed4.

13848,4,Awesome laptop..really loved its performance.. Bought it for my cousin's college work and it handles the heavy programs he runs competently
13849,4,"First things first, Its the only laptop with such balanced yet powerful configuration.If you go with thin and light type, it can only be useful in normal uses and not for high end gaming but has great battery like 6+ hrs. And if u consider gaming laptops with H series processors, we can't expect battery above 3-4 hrs even under light usage due to higher TDP.

13853,4,"It's good enough for almost anyone, So if you aren't bothered by a slightly bulki looking laptop then it's the best computer for this price range, try getting it with gst bill as you can get this for almost 46k... It's good for any workload but there is a bunch of pre installed apps so delete them when you buy (was not expecting that)"

13999,4,"this is the most premium build quality on a laptop that anyone can find at this price. the laptop is snappy as well apart from small jitters every now and then. It would be great if there is an option for a higher storage variant. because, excluding the disc c, the only usable storage is 130gb or so which is insufficient these days. but the screen and the speakers are worth it! the vertical real estate is great for ms office apps."

 Sounds:- amazing kind of sound which is truly noise isolating, Bass is literally bombastic but in terms of vocal it performs poor

Battery:- I can assure you you'll never be disappointed with its battery performance you can use it as much you want in-ear running performance is more than 3-4 hours in case it lasts more than 3 days

Touch:- it is the main problem that you're gonna face with these earphones since they can be operated with a single touch so most of the time it stops without your will. Which is really problematic for those who listen to music while laying in bed.

Connectivity:- well it has many disconnection issues sometimes the left runs while the right stops sometimes the right one works while the left one stops!! It's the problem you're definitely going to face

Price:- when it comes to price air dopes are the Ace of this segment for what it offers
But still that single touch use system is problematic!!
All you can do is just go for it!! For daily use and those of you who listens to music while laying in bed may avoid it for single touch system"

 Sounds:- amazing kind of sound which is truly noise isolating, Bass is literally bombastic but in terms of vocal it performs poor

Battery:- I can assure you you'll never be disappointed with its battery performance you can use it as much you want in-ear running performance is more than 3-4 hours in case it lasts more than 3 days

Touch:- it is the main problem that you're gonna face with these earphones since they can be operated with a single touch so most of the time it stops without your will. Which is really problematic for those who listen to music while laying in bed.

Connectivity:- well it has many disconnection issues sometimes the left runs while the right stops sometimes the right one works while the left one stops!! It's the problem you're definitely going to face

Price:- when it comes to price air dopes are the Ace of this segment for what it offers

Battery backup is good even after doing heavy usage,
Product design is also very eye catchy..I bought black one so it's really amazing to wear,
During playing Music, movie, attending calls voice function is good and hand gesture also acts very well..little confusion you will have in beginning.

One improvement boat should make
Sound latency during gaming, it is good but could have been better.

Overall this IA complete package in budget range"

14180,4,"Sound clarity is very good.
They are comfortable and can be used for longer duration.
Bass is not great but is satisfactory for daily needs.
Once fully charged the earpods last for 5-6 hours apart from that you already have the box which can charge them for another 6-7 times.

Overall i liked the product very much considering the price range."

It do has some latency while gaming( usage of wired headphones is what i recommend for gaming for precise sound and no delay). The hinge is quite loose but if handled with care, it will be okay.

But first product by amazon was good enough but one issue was there that the left button was more of a loose category

Like i felt it'll break and it happened
My heart was broken but then I decided to return it

And i got that replacement üòçüòç

14910,4,"I am writing this review after use of one month. It's my 1st-time experience using this kind of product so I bought this item. It's challenging for me to use because I do not understand when it's on or connected coz the lights blink all time. I bought this especially for using attending online meetings or long personal calls. There is no other purpose coz sometimes if the phone battery is down it's challenging to use with earphones.
The sound quality is ok while listening to anything but while making calls, I can hear clearly but the person another side can not hear anything when I am speaking with them.

This is the only issue I found. I bought it for what purpose it's not solved that. Overall look smart."

Good thing that I was able to put it back together without damaging anything, so yup! It is worth the price and it nice for a birthday gift. I just wished that the battery lasted abit longer, had few issues with it. Overall a really nice product. Worked wonderfully for this one year. If handled well with care, I believe it will work for longer."

@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
‚óè boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
‚óè JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
‚óè Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
‚óè‚óè WINNER- boAt 225 ‚óè‚óè

COMFORT :
------------
‚óè boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
‚óè JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
‚óè Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óè

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

‚óè boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
‚óè JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
‚óè Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óè

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
‚óè boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
‚óè JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
‚óè Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óè

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
‚óè boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
‚óè JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
‚óè Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
‚óè‚óè WINNER - boAt 225 ‚óè‚óè

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
‚óè boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
‚óè JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
‚óè Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
‚óè‚óè WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ‚óè‚óè

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."

I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
‚óè boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
‚óè JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
‚óè Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óè

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
‚óè boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
‚óè JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
‚óè Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
‚óè‚óè WINNER - boAt 225 ‚óè‚óè

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
‚óè boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
‚óè JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
‚óè Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
‚óè‚óè WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ‚óè‚óè

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision."

@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
‚óè boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
‚óè JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
‚óè Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
‚óè‚óè WINNER- boAt 225 ‚óè‚óè

COMFORT :
------------
‚óè boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
‚óè JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
‚óè Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óè

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

‚óè boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
‚óè JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
‚óè Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.

15580,4,"I‚Äôve repeatedly ordered ATH CLR 100 for over 5 years and i believe their built quality has degraded over years.
Let me be clear that i still absolutely love ATH‚Äôs sound reproduction but sometimes feel that the highs are just too much to bear as I‚Äôve matured as a listner ( not an audiophile ).
So for a change, i ordered these and observed the following.
1. I immediately noticed the built quality to be better.
2. The noise cancellation is far superior.
3. The mids and highs are bright enough as the lows do not overpower them despite these being marketed as ‚Äúextra bass‚Äù earphones.
Overall , if they last me 6 months or so, I‚Äôll switch to these for years to come.
Happy with the purchase."

15590,4,I've been using these since the day they arrived for my classes and other casual uses. Never noticed any huge problems yet. The mic being kinda close to the ear is the only con if you ask me. The sound quality is pretty decent(not too fancy) for the price. Both sides work properly for me unlike the other comments I read. I will update this in case anything goes wrong. Also a piece of advice Never leave your headphones plugged in(unplug them when you're not using them).

Also a piece of advice Never leave your headphones plugged in(unplug them when you're not using them).

15600,4,"Audiophile's stay away!! Its an average earphones with good build quality but volume levels are not very high so also is the bass. The bass is not ear shattering one but comfortable, you can use with full volume but will be left wanting for more volume and bass. Treble is high,mids are below avg and bass is just avg/flat. Sound clarity is also average,some mid's are just left out and not audible enough. Noise cancellation is fair enough. Fit is good and comfortable. Earlier used skullcandy earphones(1st was basic 2nd was a mid range) and these earphones from Jbl are not even close to skullcandy's."

15610,4,"I've been using this earphone since more than a year. This piece is marvellous. It sounds great. The bass and noice cancellation works pretty well (not the best in the market) but gets our job done.

It's durability has been a major concern. The outer layer of the wire gets inadequately worsen and at the end of the day you will remain with the defective piece.

I know it's quite durable. You may use it for 8-9 months regularly without any issues. But if you want longer usage you have other best options in this price range too.

Recommended this product for smooth and uninterrupted media play. Thanks"

15620,4,Excellent product. Build quality seems fickle which is also partly true. However once u hear it play your opinions will change. Deep and just the right amount of bass you can hear a different set of instruments which I was unable to hear in my other headphones. Only thing sorely missed is a braided cable or tangle free wires as they seems to get very easily mixed up. Otherwise this would have been a perfect five star product.

15630,4,"I have bought it before a week. I am looking for good sound producing headphone with decent bass and mic. I have searched little bit and found this one...
After using for a week... The Quality of sound from this is best, decent high nots and good bass than others in this price range. Music in sound is little bit higher but you can equilize it, so in sound department its one of the best.
Build quality is like average. It should lasts long if handled carefully. Single Button to play pause, change track, take and cut the calls...
So overall good one compared with others in market till now... But price is little high as compared to build quality (Bought in ‚Çπ650/-)"

16003,5,"I'm writing this after a month of usage (gaming+editing+office+coding)Pros :1) Ryzen 5 5500u is way better than the older 3500h and you can actually feel the difference (my friend have 3500h variant).2) 1660 gfx card under this price segment is a bang for buck. I had no problems playing AAA games with maxed graphics at 50+ fps. Older games like GTA 5, CSGO etc are smoother than ever. Even Minecraft with heavy texture packs runs smoothly.3) Editing ofcourse you can edit efficiently as the...READ MORE"
16004,5,This is very reliable laptop nd I used last 10 days nd after that I have give exactly review of this laptop Overall best performance nd good booting nd also u can edit video like a professional like premiere Pro
16005,5,"My OpinionAmazing product. Totally worth the price paid for. I've been using the laptop for a month now. Haven't observed any issues so far. Comes with a power efficient processor which does heavy duty tasks effortlessly. However, prolonged gaming is not recommended as it heats up after 4-5 hrs of usage. Regular day to day tasks work like charm. A must buy for Students, Office users and occasional gamers"

16007,5,"Review after 70 days. The laptop is incredibly good. All the programs works with ease. I have installed Autocad 2020, solidworks 2020 and Inventor 2020. The programs works without any trouble without charging. Battery is extremely good. The performance seems far better than the hp pavilion laptop with the same specs that I used before. The laptop boots up in lightning speed. The cooling system of this laptop is very good. The only con is speaker sound, but it least bothered me. Must go for th...READ MORE"

I use headphones so I don't mind.Also note that lifetime MS Office is not provided.I got it for 54990. Buy it asap before they increase the price even more"
16011,5,Outstanding performance in this price range like a gaming laptop in this budget I am very happy with this lappyüòò.My review after 6 months.
16012,5,Guys if you are a heavy gamer... Then u must not be here... As this price segment is not for heavy gamers... But if you are a casual gamer then trust me guys go with acer aspire 7 ryzen 5500u... It is really a battery power house... It will last almost 6 to 7 hours if you are using wifi and doing multi tasking.... And the msi gf63 thin with i5 9th Gen has a max q processor which is still not good for gaming compared to acer aspire 7 ryzen 5500u.... And you will only get 3 to 4 hrs of battery ...READ MORE
16013,5,Don't update your laptop to windows 11 with just 8gb ram better upgrade ram to 16 or 12gb coz in win 11 only 4 gb around ram available for software rest all used by windows even on idle mode.There are also some drivers issues i faced so i recommend all to stay on win 10 little bit longer until win 11 become stable and resolve bugs.There is no fan controlling software provided by acer so i suggest you to install predator sense to control fans manually as well as auto set fans to 4500rpm ma...READ MORE
16014,5,"It's the perfect laptop for me!I am a student. So I needed a good laptop with a good balance of performance and battery efficiency. Plus as I'm a YouTuber, I needed a perfect laptop for editing my videos. And this one checks all the boxes. I'm loving it!"
16015,5,The Best!It's the best performing laptop within 55k budget range. It performs like 88k+ price laptops. You can run almost every high end game on this smoothly! And Premier Pro runs buttery smooth on this machine. Only compromise you'll make is quality. It is more of a delicate product of which you have to take atmost care of.

Given its 30k lesser and has lower version of CPU.Excellent for daily tasks and browsingModerate for design workAll right for video editingOverall it's quick and good heat management with decent battery."
16019,5,"It's been a week, but the performance of this laptop has been fantastic. AMD has done a great job with their Ryzen 5500u processor; and that coupled with NVIDIA 1650 GPU delivers an exceptional performance. Cherry on the top is the SSD support - OS boot and app switching is seamless and quick. The laptop is excellent overall, and I couldn't find any significant downsides till now."

16021,5,"To be very honest this is amazing product.The only con is that build quality is not that good but you can manage. The biggest myth is sound quality which quite loud in this but the 720p camera is very very bad , like bad as my previous laptop which was just 18000 in price .In a nuty go for it don't think too much beleive me you will proud of your decision.One thing to be noted this is my review after 2 hrs of its delivery."
16022,5,Only one word - Superb!It boots up lightening fast and ready to use in just 5-8 seconds. Freaking awesome speed! All the games and apps that i have tried ran smoothly as expected and sometimes beyond expectations. The two downsides are its poor webcam ( which we never use) and the battery. The battery runs out very fast while gaming. 1-2 hours. Otherwise for normal use it will stay up for at least 5-7 hours. You can watch detailed performance reviews on YouTube and all of them are mostly true.

16024,5,"Had a little bit trouble switching from the integrated graphics but overall the laptop is debatably the best at the price it comes. Decent Battery life , good overall performance. If you can compromise on the refresh rate then go for this as it is cheaper than the 144Hz ones but performs the same. cheers!"

16028,5,"I've had this laptop for a month now and I'm all praises for this one. The hardware is the best you can get at this price point. The battery backup is pretty good, and in my one month of usage I've never faced any heating issues. The matte display is great, but the brightness is not adequate for outdoor usage.

17819,5,"The USP of this 2in1 is thr display. It is really brilliant. The colours, the sharpness: it is top notch. Like a Macbook.11th Generation i3 is equivalent to 10th Gen i5 in terms of performance. I cannot notice any difference between Ryzen 5 Hexacore of last year and this one. Haven't done gaming so cannot comment.For a 2 in 1, it is a bit heavy. And screen is not detachable to be used like a tablet.

No noticeable improvement in performance but being cat7 with its shielding and rated high frequency these should be future-proof.
Build quality is superb as always. The cable is a lot stiffer compared to the AmazonBasics cat6 cables. Not a bad thing though as it means even higher quality and no crosstalk. Superb product."

Build quality is superb as always. The cable is a lot stiffer compared to the AmazonBasics cat6 cables. Not a bad thing though as it means even higher quality and no crosstalk. Superb product."

18370,5,"Reviewing this TWS approx. 4 months, and found these TWS pretty good at this price range. The ear phones comes in rectangular charging case, which provides the charging to both the buds. The case is sturdy and solid built. The material is of plastic (glossy plastic) and looks premium quality. There are shining LEDs on the case which gives an indicator or charging left in the case / while charging they lit up in increasing gradient to show that the case is charging. When fully charged the case LEDs (4 leds) lits up continuously showing the case is fully charged.
Sound quality - In nutshell very good and satisfactory, on the contrary, I have not expected such a good quality of sound from these entry level TWS. Its simply amazing . The bass is good, mids are nice and terrible is also good. Tried these earphones on every music and the output is satisfactory . I can rate the sound quality on scale of 7/10. (there will always some lacuna or grey types but the are soo infinitesimally that it is out of scope to mention).
Latency - Basically used for music and movies (not in games), in both worked great and no delay was observed.
Charging time - approx. 2- 3 hrs.
Longevity - working good at my point of review ! last 4 months been.
Comfort - very light weight and comfortable. It fits good in ears and do not falls while walking or running.

In all, its a good TWS for those who wanna enjoy music without nit-picking the earphones."

18380,5,Still working as charm. Charges very fast. Works very very long. I saw the whole puspa movie and it was only 20% drained. The strength and durability is also good.

Might cause a bit itching irritating feeling after long use of 3-4 hrs. But other than that I would really recommend this.

18400,5,"These are good airpods in the price range of 1k, i mean Ofcourse quality depends on how much you put in the budget, anyway, what i would i like to say about this are,

Please read the instructions carefully before using these airpods,
- charge the case before first use/before connecting
- sensors are truly sensitive, so tap cautiously
- not for rough and tough usage if you want them to last for a while.
- don't use other chargers to charge it.
- clean the muffs, charger case, and sensors once in a while.

Things i didn't like are-
- full charging takes a while
- too light weight, case can be done with a better material, but Ofcourse since we are keeping money for the better sensors here, whatever.

Overall, not bad, will work well if taken care."

18405,5,"These are good airpods in the price range of 1k, i mean Ofcourse quality depends on how much you put in the budget, anyway, what i would i like to say about this are,

Please read the instructions carefully before using these airpods,
- charge the case before first use/before connecting
- sensors are truly sensitive, so tap cautiously
- not for rough and tough usage if you want them to last for a while.
- don't use other chargers to charge it.
- clean the muffs, charger case, and sensors once in a while.

Things i didn't like are-
- full charging takes a while
- too light weight, case can be done with a better material, but Ofcourse since we are keeping money for the better sensors here, whatever.

Overall, not bad, will work well if taken care."

19960,5,"You guys please take my review seriously.....
When I ordered it first time, everything was working normal. But suddenly within 3 days, the display of charging case hanged to 80%. Neither it was moving further 80% in charging, nor it was decreasing when I put my earbuds in the charging. Then I decided to replace. When I got the new one in the replacement, the battery of earbuds was 70%. When I put it in the charging case, the battery of case was 100% even the battery of earbuds was 70%, it was not automatically charging. Then When I put it in the charging when it needs only 30% of the charge, my battery of charging case decreased from 100 to 25% directly even when it's feature was to charge the earbuds 3 times.
I request you guys not to buy this product...
